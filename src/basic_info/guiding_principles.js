                        Education is a life-long pursuit. People are at their best when they never stop learning, and growing, both professionally and personally. Pursue new interests and opportunities. Be honest about what you donâ€™t know, and be eager to learn.

                        When not coding, I can usually be found with a book in hand. My favorite genres are an interesting mix of historical non-fiction and science fantasy. I'm currently reading <span>The Fate of Rome</span>, by Kyle Harper, and <span>The Fall of Hyperion</span>, by Dan Simmons.
